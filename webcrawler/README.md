webcrawler writen in python, using bs4, regex and requests modules.  It generates two text files, one with the raw text of the url requested without any javascript or html tag and another containing the anchor links avaible in the original url, without repetition.
Once you choose the first url you wish to scrape, you have the option to iterate the process trough the links found, be careful in choosing a high number to iterate, the program will visit and save each page in a text document, this process takes a relative amount of time.

            I am testing a Python3 program in several computers. To do that, I need to install a library of Python with
             pip3
            .
            So first, I was installing
             python3-pip
            in each computer (everyone is running Kubuntu OS). Everything was OK, and then I installed the package I needed with
             pip3
            , and I managed to do that except for one computer.
            In that computer,
             python3-pip
            was apparently installed succesfully, but when I look for the package, I get this error (the translation is homemade):
 The command «pip» from the package «python-pip» (universe)
pip3: command not found

             One of three things will likely fix it:
               In case
                python3-pip
               did
                not
               install correctly, re-install it:
               This is used for Debian-based distros like Ubuntu, Mint:
               If using Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, please use:
               Try using the command
                python3-pip
               instead (works on Fedora; I don't have a copy of Kubuntu to try it on).
               Just a wild guess...check
                pip --version
               . There is a slight possibility that after installing
                python3-pip
               the new
                pip
               would
                replace
               the old
                pip
               (perhaps via
                alternatives
               ?)
              EDIT
             Now that the output of
              dpkg -L python3-pip
             has been added to the question, I can provide the answer.
              The correct command name to use is:
               pip-3.2
              .

                 It's not possible to reinstall python-pip3 (in Fedora at least), since dnf depends on it. In my case, I have python-pip3 installed, it should have installed /usr/bin/pip3, but didn't.
                  rpm -ql python3-pip|grep bin/pip3
                 shows
                  /usr/bin/pip3 /usr/bin/pip3.5
                 , but
                  ls /usr/bin|grep pip3
                 doesn't find them.

                 @dfarrell07 Wrong. You are not allowed to
                  dnf remove
                 it, since
                  dnf
                 depends on it. However, you are allowed to
                  dnf reinstall
                 it, which is what is needed anyways.
                  dnf
                 (and
                  yum
                 before it) is smart enough to know that reinstalling a needed package is OK even if removing it isn't.

             I ran into this problem and found the solution. The
              python3-pip
             package installed a
              pip-3.2
             binary.
             Executing
              pip-3.2 --version
             shows:
             Whereas
              python3-pip
             gives the
              command not found
             message.
             I tested it on a "clean" download from here:
              https://sourceforge.net/projects/rpiqemuwindows/
             I checked for
              pip-3.2
             before installing
              python3-pip
             and then after.

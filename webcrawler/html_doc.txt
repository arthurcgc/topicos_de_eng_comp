The Secret Hacker Code – Hacker NoonHomepageFollowSign inGet startedHomeLatestLearn BlockchainDevAIUpcoming Podcast GuestsBlockchain ExpertsCrypto LifeDo What You LoveChris CastiglioneBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingCo-founder OneMonth.comSep 27The Secret Hacker CodeFour principles that differentiate ordinary computer programmers from hackers.In college, I had no idea how to code. I was determined to make my own music sharing app (like Napster!), but I didn’t have a clue how to start.That summer, I befriended a hacker. His name was The Lion King (seriously, as in his screen name was LionKing909). And he taught me lots of new tricks:But most notably, he introduced me to The Hacker Ethic — four principles that differentiate ordinary computer programmers from hackers. The Hacker Ethic inspired me deeply. Eventually, I decided I wouldn’t just learn to code: I would become a hacker.What is a hacker?Defining hacker isn’t so straightforward. The name has an “I know it when I see it” ring to it. Most computer programmers are hackers, but not all of them.For some, the word hacker conjures up images of Soviet tech experts breaking into CIA computers, or criminals wearing Guy Fawkes masks, Mr. Robot-style. Those people certainly exist, but a hacker who hacks maliciously or for personal gain is a specific type of hacker known as a black hat hacker. Black hat hackers are an unfortunate distraction from all the kickass white hat hackers out there — the people who built and are continuing to build the internet that billions of people use every day!In general, hackers are problem solvers. Hackers are scrappy. Hackers express themselves with computer code and use their skills to solve problems.Steve Wozniak is a hacker, and yet Bill Gates, while he certainly has displayed hacker-ish qualities, clashed quite seriously with the hacker community in the mid-70s when he famously began selling his software. To understand the distinction, as well as the causes of many of the most famous tech decisions of the past century, by everyone from Steve Jobs, to Satoshi Nakamoto, you’re going to need to understand the secret code of hackers.The Hacker EthicAll hackers (good and evil) share a core belief that information should be free. This was distilled into text for the first time by Steven Levy in his 1984 book Hackers. In the book, Levy outlined The Hacker Ethic — a code of beliefs embraced by nearly all computer hackers. The ethics weren’t crafted by Steven Levy or any one person to dictate how hackers should act, rather they’re a reflection of the hacker culture that has grown organically over many decades.My hope in sharing The Hacker Ethic here is to give you a deeper understanding of how hackers think. One day you may hire a hacker, work with one, or wish to become one yourself. In that case, consider this your first step into their culture. These are the top four principles of The Hacker Ethic.1. “Information should be free”“Free” information means the freedom to copy existing code and to share that information with others.The first generation of hackers began with a group of students at MIT in the 1950s. After hours, they would sneak into the Lincoln Library on campus where they’d vie for a few hours to play with the $3 million TX-0 computer. Unlike today where most students have individual laptops, passwords, and seemingly unlimited time to spend on their computers, the MIT hackers shared just one computer. There were no passwords, so any one person’s code could be viewed by anyone else on the system. The early hackers were ok with this. More than ok, actually, because they quickly found value in sharing code.The original MIT hackers quickly began collaborating on building software. Why build competing versions of software, when we can instead work together to share knowledge and create the very best version? That’s the hackers way.Today the entire world benefits from the decisions of these early hackers.One of the most meaningful outcomes is the Free and Open Source Software movement. Started by Richard Stallman in 1985, the free software movement encourages millions of people to share, copy, and remix code.Today 80% of smartphones, and 80% of websites run on free software (aka. Linux, the most famous open source operating system). In addition, WordPress, Wikipedia, and nearly all programming languages are all free! All thanks to The Hacker Ethic.The GPL License (written by Richard Stallman), and the MIT License are two examples of software licenses that render The Hacker Ethic into a legal text. “Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software…,” says the opening paragraph of the MIT license.These licenses help explain why no one “owns” the internet (as we’ll discuss in future chapters). Back in the 1990s, Tim Berners Lee released his original World Wide Web software under the MIT license. When Napster was shut down in 2001, it was easy for copycat sites to pop up because — you guessed it — open source versions were already free to share!2. Computers can change your life for the better.Hackers see computer programming not merely as a technical pursuit, but also as a tool for making the world a better place.For example, hackers can write code to automate redundant tasks…And they spread free information with the goal of improving the quality of human life…“Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That’s what we’re doing.” — Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia FounderThis tenet of using computers to “improve life for the better” goes all the way back to Vannevar Bush who, in 1945, published the essay “As We May Think,” in which he pressed scientists to stop building war machines and to consider using technology as a force for good.“As We May Think,” Vannevar Bush (1945)These days, the phrase “make the world a better place” has become so embedded in Silicon Valley culture that it’s satirized as a running gag on the TV series Silicon Valley. On the show, every startup founder seems to justify their actions through the mantra “we’re making the world a better place.”We’re making the world a better place…Whether hackers these days are authentically upholding The Hacker Ethic, or just paying it lip service is up for debate. What remains true is The Hacker Ethic’s influence on both hacker culture and our society.3. Mistrust authority — promote decentralizationHackers are encouraged to think critically and to challenge the status quo.In the 1960s, Americans were wary of organizations where only a few powerful people controlled the flow of information. Think: Nazi Germany, The Soviet Union spying vigilantly its own people, and the omen “Big Brother is watching you” as described in George Orwell’s 1984. Hackers promote decentralization in order to dilute the concentration of power and fight to redistribute that power among the many.Hackers Promote DecentralizationOne way hackers promote decentralization is by building tools. Bitcoin is a tool that was created by Satoshi Nakamoto that completely removes the authority (and thus power) of banks. Bitcoin allows individuals to manage, send and receive money in a decentralized manner.Hackers also promote decentralization in their social organizations. WordPress is a software ecosystem that was created by thousands of developers around the world — most of who have never met each other. Many startups attempt to emulate this model of communication with flat company structure (aka. A boss-less culture) so that employees can make decisions without constantly needing to ask permission.4. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not based on degrees, age, race, sex, or positionHackers judge each other by the quality of their code. This helps explain how Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg could drop out of Harvard build billion dollar companies. Code is meritocratic.A hacker doesn’t need permission to hack. Your ability is not defined by who you know, or your expensive computer science degree. If your dog writes JavaScript better than you, then the dog should be hired. As Bill Gates has said, “If you want to hire an engineer, look at the guy’s code. That’s all.”The Swarm of BeesA swarm of decentralized beesIn the 1960s, the early hackers were buzzing like a gigantic swarm of bees. MIT was a beehive in the east, and Silicon Valley in the west.How do hundreds of bees coordinate? Contrary to popular belief, they’re not led by the queen bee — she stays in the hive. Bees rely on decentralized decision making for critical choices. It is for that reason that bees are often cited as a visual metaphor for how decentralized groups organize.In the 1960s, The Hacker Ethic was story that helped organize strangers around a single mission: keep code free, and make the world a better place. Everything was buzzing along smoothly. And then someone kicked the nest…Coming up next: The incident that spread The Hacker Ethic from the halls of academia and out into the rest of the world. And if you missed part one you can read it now at The History of the Internet.Very special thanks to Pippa Biddle, and Alexis Rondeau for reading early drafts and providing countless insights.CodingEntrepreneurshipHackathonsSecret Hacker CodeHacker Code1942BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingChris CastiglioneCo-founder OneMonth.comFollowHacker Noonhow hackers start their afternoons.194Never miss a story from Hacker Noon, when you sign up for Medium.

Android Nears 80% Market Share In Global Smartphone Shipments, As iOS And BlackBerry Share Slides, Per IDC – TechCrunch
Android Nears 80% Market Share In Global Smartphone Shipments, As iOS And BlackBerry Share Slides, Per IDC
Darrell Etherington
@etherington
/
5 years
Android smartphone shipments grew a whopping 73.5 percent between the second quarter of 2012 and Q2 2013, according to research firm IDC’s latest numbers. 187.4 million Android-powered phones shipped in the most recent quarter, representing 79.3 percent of all smartphones shipped during the quarter. The next closest smartphone platform was iOS, which shipped just 31.2 million units, accounting for 13.2 percent of overall share.
Apple’s mobile OS still blew away its next closest competitor (and still grew 20 percent in terms of device shipments year over year), Windows Phone, which saw 8.7 million handsets shipped for 3.7 percent share of the global market. But Windows Phone also experienced growth at roughly the same rate, with shipments overall climbing 77.6 percent year over year. BlackBerry, predictably, hurt the worst of the major players, dropping from 4.9 percent overall share to just 2.9 percent, and shipping 11.7 percent fewer devices than during the same time last year.
What’s causing the big Android bump IDC says the Samsung Galaxy S4 was a strong driver, but LG, Huawei, Lenovo and ZTE also had really good quarters with shipments in the double digits. The Android platform represented a win for almost everyone playing in that sandbox, however, as even small manufacturers saw success targeting small, niche markets in developing countries with affordable smartphones.
Windows Phone owes almost all of its growth to Nokia, which accounted for 81.6 percent of all smartphones shipped based on Microsoft’s mobile platform during the quarter. BlackBerry hit a new all-time low, in terms of IDC’s history of tracking market share. IDC says not to count them out because of BB10 progress, but it’s no secret that things are looking grim for the Canadian smartphone pioneer.
The big takeaway here is pretty clear, in terms of the top two players: Android is on fire because of choice, availability and price point in emerging markets focused on shifting to smartphones from feature phones on limited budgets. That means it’s even more crucial to watch what Apple debuts this fall in terms of a low-cost iPhone device, which is rumored to be based around the iPhone 5 and sport a plastic back that’s cheaper to produce.

Medium membership - Unlimited access to the best of MediumHomepageOur storyAbout membershipHomepageSome thoughts are worth more than a penny.Become a member for unlimited, ad-free reading. Just $5/month or $50/year.Continue with GoogleContinue with FacebookHave an account? Sign inWhat you getThe best of Medium, from your commute to your coffee break• Unlimited access to timely, expert stories from top writers• Zero ads• Audio versions of popular stories and offline reading• Curated selections from leading media outletsWhat members are sayingI am endlessly inspired and impressed with the quality creative content I read on the site.Kristin GarthI think writers should work for readers instead of advertisers, so I’m voting with my credit card. I happily pay for products I love. Writing is no exception.Andrew CourterLearn more about MediumLearn more about membershipFrequently asked questionsFaqsWhat do I get as a member?When you upgrade, you’ll unlock all the stories published for members by top writers and leading experts on Medium. (When you read and clap for those stories as a member, part of your $5/month goes directly to that author.) You’ll also be able to listen to audio versions of hundreds of popular stories handpicked by our editors. And you’ll be able to save stories to your offline reading list and archive.As a member, how am I supporting writers and publishers?As a member, your $5/month goes toward funding the authors and publishers who write the member content you enjoy. When you read and engage with a story published for members, you’re allocating more money for that author or publication, especially when you clap. At the end of the month, we’ll divvy up your contributions based on all your reading time, applause, and engagement from that period, and it will directly go to the writers and publishers of that content.Can links to stories for members be shared on social media?We encourage you to share stories for members on social media (and authors would appreciate that, too). Readers who are not members can still access a limited number of stories for free each month before they need to upgrade.What determines if a story is for members?Writers choose the audience of their stories on Medium. By designating a story for members, writers can be compensated for their work based on member engagement. Non-members can still read a limited number of these member stories per month. Alternatively, writers can choose to make their story available to all readers on Medium without restrictions and will not be paid.Do I have to be a member if I want to write stories for members?Writers do not have to become members themselves to publish stories for members. Once a writer or publication registers for the Medium Partner Program (for free), they can publish as many stories as they’d like for members. They’ll be able to view and see activity on their own stories for members for free, as well. Our membership is designed for readers, and we aren’t planning to add any features for writers as part of it.How will I be billed for my membership?Your credit card will be charged $5 USD monthly or $50 USD yearly, based on the plan you select. You can cancel your plan at any time via your Medium settings page. There are no refunds or credits for partial months. If you would like an invoice, please contact yourfriends@medium.com.

Kavanaugh is the Face of American Male Rage – Jessica Valenti – MediumHomepageBecome a memberSign inGet startedHomepageJessica ValentiKavanaugh is the Face of American Male RageMen are being held accountable — and it has them mad as hellJessica ValentiBlockedUnblockFollowFollowinga few hours agoPhoto: Pool/GettyPhoto: Pool/GettyIt was the laughing, she said, that she couldn’t forget. Christine Blasey Ford, in testimony lauded on both sides of the political aisle as credible and moving, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 27 that the amusement of her tormentors was the most lasting memory of the sexual attack she alleges Brett Kavanaugh committed in 1982.“They were laughing with each other,” she said through tears, “two friends having a really good time with one another.”A cruel irony of sexual assault and harassment is that the traumas which frequently determine the trajectory of women’s lives are just as often unremarkable to the men who have inflicted them.This is why, I suspect, these men become so shocked and enraged when they’re asked to answer for their actions: When they say “nothing happened,” it’s not just a denial — it’s that they truly believe the incident was not a big deal.Incredulous male rage has snowballed recently, rolling alongside the #MeToo movement at a steady pace and picking up steam over the last month. Men accused of being abusers are demanding back their coveted spots as comedians, writers, radio hosts and more. How dare women take them away to begin with!Yesterday, Kavanaugh was the face of that backlash — an avatar for entitled, white male rage in the U.S. Angry, sputtering, petulant — the judge could barely contain his fury over being expected to answer for himself. As Slate’s Lili Loofbourow put it: “This person does not seem to have a lot of experience coping with not getting what he wants.”Instead of responding to questions directly, Kavanaugh repeated his professional and academic bonafides as if his elite background was proof of good character. When Senator Sheldon Whitehouse asked the judge about references in his high school yearbook about drinking to the point of vomiting, Kavanaugh responded, “I was at the top of my class academically.”“Captain of the varsity basketball team,” he continued. “Got in Yale College. When I got into Yale College, got into Yale Law School.”Don’t you know who I am?When Sen. Amy Klobuchar — who prefaced her questions with anecdote about her own father’s alcoholism — asked Kavanaugh if he had ever blacked out, the judge snapped, “Have you?” Even after she repeated the question, once again Kavanaugh sneered: “I’m curious if you have.”In that moment, it was not hard to imagine the belligerent, drunk Brett Kavanaugh as described by his former classmates.Alexandra Schwartz at the New Yorker called this behavior “a model of American conservative masculinity…directly tied to the loutish, aggressive frat-boy persona that Kavanaugh is purportedly seeking to dissociate himself from.”And, as is often the case with frat boys, Kavanaugh’s brothers had his back. One after another, the male Senators gave emotional apologies to the judge for even having to be there, bemoaning the loss of his life and reputation. Like Kavanaugh, they were appalled that the judge was expected to explain himself.As if the possibility of him not ascending to the Supreme Court — and just continuing to serve on the second most important court in the country — would be a travesty. As if Kavanaugh was owed a smooth, unquestioned, path to whatever he wanted.And with that, the hearing stopped being about Blasey Ford’s experience or even Kavanaugh’s fitness for the job, and instead became a stage for broader and bitter male resentment — furious over the seemingly new expectation of accountability, and raging over not immediately being given what was promised to them.That Blasey Ford was so accommodating and kind throughout the day — repeating multiple times that she just wanted to be helpful — only drove home this feeling: Even as women calmly and expertly explain the ways in which men have hurt us, our pain is immediately drowned out and glossed over by men’s belief that they should not have to answer to us, of all people.My optimistic side would like to think that yesterday was the last loud gasp of a dying patriarchy, an astounded sexist minority trying its best to rebel against an emerging feminist majority. The less hopeful part of me, though — the part that still thinks quite a lot about America’s history of choosing poorly between a measured, informed woman and a belligerent, snapping man — is worried that Kavanaugh, and the men like him, will still be laughing in the end.3.2Kwritten byJessica ValentiFeminist author & columnist.BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDiscover MediumWelcome to a place where words matter.

Yankun Zhao: Student Journalist, World on His ShouldersHomepageBecome a memberSign inGet startedHomepageThe Edge of AdulthoodYankun Zhao: Student Journalist, World on His Shoulders“I like to remain pessimistic about the future because that encourages me to do everything I need to to ensure an optimistic future.”Anna PeeleBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 27Illustration: Claire MerchlinskyIllustration: Claire MerchlinskyHonolulu, HawaiiMedium: Have you lived in Hawaii your whole life?Yankun Zhao: No, I have not, actually. I was originally born in China, and I moved to the islands in 2010. My stepdad is American, and my mom is from China, and around early elementary school, my stepfather realized that the education that they were teaching in China, specifically English, was not on par to what he experienced.What struck you most when you moved here?Well, I think first is the diversity. I actually landed in San Francisco first, because I was planning to visit my grandparents when I first came to America. When I got to the airport, there were just people of all different races and cultures and backgrounds, whereas in China, there’s not really that much diversity. And for Hawaii, I just remember just how pretty it was. Growing up in a huge metropolitan area, I never really had the opportunity to explore nature and to appreciate all the beauty that’s around me.You’re a permanent resident right now, not yet a citizen. But when you become a citizen, will immigration be an issue you vote on?I definitely think so. As an immigrant myself, I think I’m more sympathetic to the immigrants, because if I did not have the opportunity to move to the United States, I would not be — first of all, having this conversation — and second, I would not be at this school getting the education I need to make an impact on the world in the future.What do you think your generation will change or do better once you’re in power?People of today believe in climate change and understand that there are consequences. A few generations from now, my children and the children of my children may not be able to experience all the nature that I’m experiencing right now. It sort of reminds me of a movie I remember seeing — it’s called Soylent Green. It’s about this postapocalyptic world where the lower class, the only food they have access to is this canned good called Soylent Green. And what’s revealed at the end of the movie is that it’s actually recycled people, because all of the resources, all of the things that exist in the world today — animals and trees, rivers — all of these things are no longer present, and we only have images and movies and clips of them to remember a world that doesn’t really exist anymore. Not that I think that’s what I think our future is going to be like, but I definitely think people understand the consequences now more than ever, and I think for my generation, this is a problem that all of us understand and that we will try to fix.What else keeps you up at night?I think right now it is what our country is turning into. The Washington Post’s slogan is “democracy dies in darkness,” and I think we’re in the time where the foundation of this nation is continuously being challenged. Not that this nation hasn’t experienced that before. But we are in a dire time. Every time something like this happens, it’s always a dire situation. And as the editor of my school’s newspaper, seeing the free press being attacked and seeing the free press threatened, that definitely concerns me. I feel like we are losing that pillar that holds up our country.So, I can’t tell: Are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future?I like to remain pessimistic about the future, because that encourages me to do everything I need to to ensure an optimistic future. But ultimately, I’m hopeful.This interview is part of The Edge of Adulthood: Forty-Six American Teens Discuss Their Lives, Their Struggles, and What’s Next.6written byAnna PeeleAnna is a writer in New York.BlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDiscover MediumWelcome to a place where words matter.

The Most Powerful New Voting Bloc in America Doesn’t VoteHomepageBecome a memberSign inGet startedHomepageYouth, NowThe Most Powerful New Voting Bloc in America Doesn’t VoteYoung people have the power to dominate U.S. policy, but they’ve been sidelined for years. Will they vote in November? It depends.Rachel SladeBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 13Art: Maria ChimishkyanArt: Maria ChimishkyanLoading…0:0027:34An enormous voting bloc is about to come of age.By 2020, 27 percent of the U.S. electorate — some 54 million people — will be between the ages of 18 and 29. This group, comprising the trailing edge of millennials and the first crop of voting-age Gen Zers, represented less than 20 percent of the voting population in the 2016 election. They’re now gaining the electoral muscle to determine the course of U.S. policy for decades to come.That future should be progressive. In poll after poll, these voters lean far left of their elders. The bulk of them have registered unaffiliated or Democrat, but regardless of their declared party, they tend toward liberal on every major issue — including immigration, the environment, and gun control, according to a 2018 study by the Institute of Politics (IOP) at Harvard University, and they overwhelmingly disapprove of President Trump.There’s just one problem: They don’t vote. In the 2014 midterms, a miserable 12 percent of eligible 18-to-21-year-old college and university students participated in the election. In 2016, with a highly controversial presidency at stake, less than half of college undergraduates voted.With the chance to flip the House this November, hope has bloomed that these voters — let’s call them MillZees — will finally turn out. But while some analysts expect an onslaught at the polls this fall, the reality is far less certain. In discussions with get-out-the-vote advocates, voting experts, political analysts, and MillZees themselves, I discovered a vast chasm between the vibrant voter-registration movement and the number of candidates who actually connect with younger Americans enough to inspire them to pull a lever. And I learned that while youth voters sincerely want change, they are at once cynical, overwhelmed, and remarkably ill-informed about how the government operates.In 2014, 26 percent of eighth-graders scored “below basic” on the civics part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, commonly called the Nation’s Report Card.But most of all, I found this: It’s not their fault.Instead, it’s the product of a decades-long sequence of events — some deliberately engineered to freeze out the youth vote, others the unintended consequence of well-meaning but misguided social and educational programs — which has resulted in some 54 million young American citizens forfeiting even the slightest inclination to participate in American democracy. How do we get them back? The answer is complicated.Seen, Not HeardThe disenfranchisement of young people from U.S. politics started decades ago.Social and political unrest in the 1960s rattled Americans’ faith in their government. That distrust spawned an educational movement that ditched basic civics classes for the more nebulous “social studies,” says Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. Those old-school government lessons — the kind that taught young Americans the mechanics of their political system — were replaced by history-focused coursework.On the left, the movement was seen as a way to start fresh by teaching a broader range of ideas and contexts. On the right, the movement seemed like a great way to remove any whiff of liberal partisanship from public schools. Whatever the goal, civics education has declined ever since — its slide accelerating when George W. Bush’s No Child Left Behind Act passed in 2002 without a mandate to test for civics knowledge. In 2014, just 22 percent of eighth-graders scored “proficient” on the civics part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, commonly called the Nation’s Report Card. That same year, 26 percent of students scored “below basic.”During that period, American politics have also become intensely polarized. Any political discussion in school is viewed with deep suspicion by parents, administrators, and politicians who are obsessed with stealth ideologues who might be influencing children’s political beliefs. The result is that students no longer have a moderated, safe space where they can explore political issues, and teachers are afraid to address thorny issues. Emily O’Hara, a junior at UConn Storrs, says that in her high school civics class, the teacher would change the subject when discussions got too contentious.That comes as no surprise to Kawashima-Ginsberg. Her 2012 survey of 800 civics teachers across the country found that more than 25 percent reported they dreaded community pushback if they talked about current events in the classroom. Many of these teachers got their first taste of this new order after having their students watch President Obama’s 2008 inauguration in the classroom — only to find themselves subjected to irate phone calls and threats of lawsuits from parents who claimed that the act of witnessing the transfer of power to a Democratic president in school was partisan.Young voters’ lack of access to information about issues and candidates keeps them from casting votes. “We don’t read,” says one.Since then, parents across the country have become ever more adamant that their public school teachers avoid talking about current elections and political issues. Kawashima-Ginsberg says that during the 2016 election, fearing virulent backlash, civics teachers across the country reported that they avoided discussing current events entirely. “There’s a real fear in schools to talk about politics,” she says. “Teachers are disempowered, and we are not testing for civic fluency, so they have no incentive to teach it.”Those same high school students will soon be eligible to register as voters. For the first time, they will be confronted with political choices that will directly affect them. Lacking the necessary tools to understand and debate issues, and without an even basic understanding of how government works, they’re falling hopelessly behind.“We Don’t Read”“Rock the Vote” has come to sound like something your dad did while wearing plaid flannel in the ’90s, so the get-out-the-vote (GOTV) movement is trying a reboot. Idealistic, earnest, and at least superficially hip, new nonprofit/nonpartisan GOTV organizations abound. They’re firmly rooted on college campuses, sending out packs of cheerful undergrads to knock on dorm room doors, testify in classrooms, and staff tables around the quad. The Parkland survivors even caravanned across the country to get their fellow young Americans registered. This summer, voter registration booths also popped up at festivals like Pitchfork, Coachella, Bonnaroo — anywhere twentysomethings were known to gather.One of these young activists is Karl Catarata. A junior at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, he spent his spring semester registering classmates on a campus just 1.3 miles from where a gunman murdered 58 people last October. Catarata is motivated by a lot of things — especially gun control — though he’s not allowed to engage potential voters on specific issues, as GOTV organizations are emphatically nonpartisan. This makes an already hard sell even harder.Catarata says that a lot of his fellow students don’t register because they’re suspicious: “They’re worried they’ll get jury duty, or their information will be shared, or someone will steal their Social Security number,” he says. Many classmates claim to be too busy to pay attention, or they’re wary of the process, or they’re just too far behind to catch up. “A few people have said that the system is rigged against them.”With all the energy around getting kids registered, their lack of access to information about issues and candidates keeps them from casting votes. MillZees are just as distrustful of the media as their fellow Americans (according to a 2018 Knight Foundation poll, 66 percent of Americans say the news media does a poor job of separating fact from opinion). They depend heavily on social media for news — Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook — but don’t know how to ferret out trustworthy intel about their government, candidates, and issues. And wherever they get information, they typically don’t go beyond headlines. “We don’t read,” admits Sam Davis, a sophomore and chemical engineering major at UMass Amherst.It’s true: MillZees don’t read. Much. Even though Catarata at UNLV is politically active and planning to vote, even he usually just scans headlines. “I’ll scroll through the news on Twitter, see what’s hot. If someone on Facebook posts an article, I’ll read it.” In general, Catarata says, he and his peers are too busy to follow what’s happening.Kyle Clauss, a New Jersey native and graduate student at Vermont Law School, gets much of his information from podcasts, including Pod Save America, The Dig, and Intercepted, while driving or doing the dishes. Although he was formerly in journalism, he’s wary of mainstream sources: “It’s tough because the whole fake news thing has opened a Pandora’s box. Even legacy publications like the New York Times don’t always get it right,” Clauss says. “There’s no purely good source.”Like other MillZees, Kyleigh Hillerud, a sophomore at UConn Storrs who’s voting by absentee ballot in New York this November, reads headlines on Twitter and Facebook, but says, “There’s only so much you can get from them,” which is why she seeks out a variety of competing news sources, including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, CNN, and Fox News to try to get at the truth of the matter. “My father taught me to do that,” Hillerud says. She admits that she’s unusual: “I know very few people who do what I do — my friends in upstate New York might read a headline but they don’t dig into it.”While they may not read, MillZees are refreshingly self-aware about their current condition: “We complain, but we don’t vote. We don’t feel empowered. We’re easily distracted and unsure about how to make ourselves heard,” says Davis, who is registered in his home state of Connecticut but had no plans to vote until we talked about it in early August. He’d never heard of the absentee ballot until I mentioned it. “There are issues we care a lot about, but we’re confused about how we can change things.”The Candidate ProblemEven if voting advocates could get past MillZees’ cynicism, apathy, and civic ignorance, come November, they’re up against an even bigger problem: the candidates themselves.On a hot August day in Chicago, Kenan, the UMass Amherst undergrad, checked out his gubernatorial candidates’ websites. The two contenders are ultra-wealthy white men — Bruce Rauner and J.B. Pritzker — already a turnoff for young voters. Together they’ve been spending $300,000 a day on their campaigns, but their websites felt canned. The candidates have invested heavily in traditional media, which twentysomethings, including Kenan, don’t watch. And both candidates focus on the same issues, few of which resonated with him. Rauner, the incumbent Republican, preaches the gospel of low taxes, which invokes eye rolls.Many analysts use social media stats as an indicator for youth support, and while Rauner has 2,800 Instagram followers and 29,000 Twitter followers, he has abysmal engagement on both platforms, which made Kenan suspect that the followers were fake. Pritzker, the Democratic challenger running on an anti-Trump platform, has fewer than 3,400 Instagram followers, and his 26,000 Twitter followers are equally disengaged. Fake again? The research felt too much like work. After five minutes of poking around, Kenan gave up. There was more interesting stuff to look at out there.Young voters stay home because the candidates aren’t representing their interests, and the winning candidates ignore them when they get into office, opting to instead push the agenda of the older voters who elected them.With all the talk of the historic number of women and minority candidates making bids for elected office this fall, most contests remain white guy vs. white guy affairs, which draw scant MillZee (and internet) interest. Nineteen of the 35 gubernatorial races and 189 of the House races are exclusively white-man showdowns. Same with 15 of the 35 Senate races (the balance includes white women). In their photos and on their formulaic websites, the candidates look remarkably similar. To distinguish them, you need a nuanced approach — the kind you get from media literacy and background knowledge, which MillZees don’t have, and reading, which they don’t do.But it’s more than that. By and large, these candidates don’t address the issues that most directly affect MillZee voters. Three-quarters of MillZees say that gun control is their most important issue in the upcoming election, according to the IOP survey, but most candidates, fearing NRA backlash, won’t touch that one. Nearly half of millennials on a Pew survey say they can’t afford routine health care costs and see universal health care as the solution. The bulk of politicians talk around health care — offering up every flavor of public-private solution imaginable — but rare is the candidate who embraces a single-payer system. Millennial and Gen Z parents and students hold an estimated $1.2 trillion in education debt, but good luck finding a lawmaker who will stump on tackling that. Indeed, the 2018 GOP tax plan eliminated many income tax deductions that MillZees and their parents benefited from, including student loan interest, mortgage interest, and grants and scholarships. “We cannot get leaders to care about us,” says Emily O’Hara, a junior at UConn Storrs and ardent voting advocate.It’s not entirely the leaders’ fault. MillZees are practically unreachable via mainstream campaign methods, so many a political manager advises his or her clients to skip them. The candidates do. Young voters stay home because the candidates aren’t representing their interests, and the winning candidates ignore them when they get into office, opting to instead push the agenda of the older voters who elected them. The cynicism deepens, apathy ensues, more neglect follows. It’s a vicious circle.The Authenticity ThingThe thing is, MillZees will vote. But only under specific circumstances.They’ve been marketed, messaged, and data-mined to death, so they bristle at anything that feels inauthentic. Painful backstories and straight talk, the currency of YouTubers and celebrities alike, will always resonate more than polished performances.Two things will drive youth voters to the polls: identity and, if that isn’t in play, authenticity. Identity functions as a kind of shorthand for connection or realness. A compelling backstory coupled with racial and gender otherness — a “lived experience” — is MillZee political gold. Easy to capture in just a few words, identity slices through the internet noise and can’t be faked. (Or one would think. Julia Salazar, a progressive social Democrat running for state Senate in New York, has been accused of fabricating certain biographical details, including where she was born, to appear more disadvantaged. Regardless, the youth voters seem to be standing by her, for now.)This year, campaigns with a lived-experience theme are proven winners. You couldn’t cook up a better test for this hypothesis than Massachusetts’ 7th Congressional District primary, where Ayanna Pressley, a 44-year-old black female Boston city counselor, challenged a progressive 66-year-old white male incumbent who’d held the seat for 19 years. Their politics were nearly identical, but Pressley’s identity as a black woman with a history of sexual abuse captivated younger voters. The day before the primary, Pressley boasted 37,500 engaged Twitter followers (Capuano had a fourth as many), along with 7,100 enthusiastic Instagram followers (her opponent wasn’t on IG). Pressley won with 59 percent of the vote, and, with no Republican opponent, she’s heading to D.C.Authentic messaging works across the political spectrum.In the Georgia Democratic primary, Stacey Abrams, the black female candidate for governor, trounced her white female opponent by a huge margin: 300,000 votes. Her top issue is health care. Abrams has 118,000 Twitter followers ready to mobilize against her conservative white male opponent this November. And in Florida, black gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum bucked conventional wisdom when he triumphed over former congresswoman Gwen Graham, who is white, in the Democratic primary. Gillum is unquestionably progressive and speaks the MillZee language. The simple tweet, “We should pay teachers what they are worth. And with your help, we will,” drew 48,000 likes in just 16 hours.Combine those optics with Bernie Sanders’ youth agenda and you’ve bottled lightning. Following the Vermont senator’s road map is first-time candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old MillZee of Puerto Rican heritage who beat a powerful white male incumbent in New York’s congressional primary in great part because she championed the MillZee platform, which includes the elimination of government-held student loans and zero tuition at public colleges. Ocasio-Cortez’s straightforward approach passes the MillZee authenticity test, while her skillful use of social media (she’s a native user, after all) has drawn national attention and nearly a million Twitter followers.A few white male candidates have successfully tapped into the MillZee quest for authenticity as well. In Texas, youthful Beto O’Rourke, a progressive Democratic congressman running against Ted Cruz, may look like the hated patriarchy (down to his $7 million personal net worth), but he’s pro-choice, pro–gun control, and left-leaning on immigration. He also knows how to sound real. His one-minute low-fi iPhone video campaign ad, “Showing Up,” which captures O’Rourke pounding the pavement and shaking hands throughout Texas, has racked up more than 300,000 views on YouTube, and the comments section is open, inviting haters and lovers alike. The candidate boasts 461,000 Twitter followers, and his tweets consistently garner several thousand likes. Accordingly, O’Rourke grabbed 62 percent of the votes in the Democratic primary. There’s little doubt that young voters will come out to support him this fall.Authentic messaging works across the political spectrum. Some conservative lawmakers’ straight-talk stylings pass the MillZee test, and they’re reaping the rewards as well. Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse’s no-bullshit attitude has been known to resonate with youth voters (116,000 engaged Twitter followers), even if his politics don’t (he earns a Trump score of 86.7 percent on FiveThirtyEight). “He’s relatively young and talks a good line while backing very conservative policies,” says Meredith Ferguson, the managing director of DoSomething Strategic who closely follows youth voter trends. In Sasse’s recent book, Ferguson says, he “called millennials ‘needy, undisciplined, coddled, presumptuous’ young people who lack ‘much of a filter between their public personas and their inner lives.’” She adds, “Not sure how well known that is among young voters.” Nevertheless, MillZees appreciate his frank and forthright attitude.Another Republican who’s got the youth vote despite his deep-red politics: Will Hurd, of Texas’ 23rd District. A former CIA agent who, like Obama, has a white mother and black father, Hurd won his seat twice on razor-thin margins in a predominantly Hispanic district. He’s 40 years old, smart, and quiet, and he appears thoughtful on issues, especially the immigration question, which his constituents deeply care about. But ignore any progressive rhetoric: Hurd earned a whopping 95.6 percent Trump score on FiveThirtyEight. Bill Lee, running for governor in Tennessee, is another GOP straight-talking candidate attracting MillZee attention. Despite his homespun “Tennessee is my home, I’m with the folks” messaging, Lee’s about as anti-progressive as you can get.Are there conservative MillZee voters? Of course. But based on the cohort’s pronounced leftward lean, these outliers suggest a vulnerability: a difficulty telling the difference between performance and substance — meaning that if you can figure out a way to connect to them, they might love you back, even if your politics will ultimately crush their dreams. They certainly wouldn’t be alone among American voters in that regard, but coupled with the apathy and civic illiteracy, it’s a troubling characteristic.The Fight for (and Against) College StudentsAll of this year’s focus on youth voters has spooked Republicans who don’t want the MillZee agenda derailing GOP momentum. Their response, by and large, has been to move to make it as hard as possible for young people to vote.Threatened by Gillum’s rising-star status in Florida, Republican Governor Rick Scott’s administration tried to block early voting on college campuses. (A federal judge struck down the attempt.) As soon as Abrams won the Georgia gubernatorial primary, with a huge youth- and black-voter lead, the Republican administration tried to close dozens of majority-black polling places around the state. (It took media reporting and the ACLU to block the measure.) In New Hampshire, a new state law requires that registered voters obtain a state driver’s license within 60 days of voting and register their vehicles in the state. Voter advocates view this as a blatant attempt to get the collegiate carpetbaggers out of local politics.In early August, in response to Beto O’Rourke and other progressive candidates running in Texas, a state commission proposed shuttering 87 Department of Public Safety driver’s license offices ahead of the election, under the guise that the sites were “inefficient.” If a panel of alert legislators hadn’t stopped the proposal, some Texans would have had to drive up to 100 additional miles in pursuit of a government-issued ID so they could represent this fall.This year’s focus on youth voters has spooked Republicans. Their response, by and large, has been to move to make it as hard as possible for young people to vote.Lawmakers are also doing their damnedest to keep political discourse off campuses—the places where many Americans experience their first civic awakening. Seven states have proposed or passed college campus “free-speech laws,” which, despite the name, actually strip universities of their independence. Tennessee’s Campus Free Protection Act, inspired by student protests against the likes of Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos, allows outside speakers to demand reparations from institutions if their events are canceled. Faculty neutrality laws under consideration in some states will make it more difficult for professors to speak freely about the government, issues, and those in power. The recent Tennessee law, for example, allows schools to punish faculty if their class content is “not reasonably germane to the subject matter of the class as broadly construed, and comprises a substantial portion of classroom instruction.” College and university administrators, fearful of defunding and fomenting political ire, have been reluctant to push back.Still, there is momentum in the opposite direction, at least toward getting students some semblance of a civic education. In 2012, as the U.S. Department of Education challenged institutions to offer programs and experiences that would get the students more engaged in democracy, Nancy Thomas, the director of the Institute for Democracy and Higher Education at Tufts University, initiated the most sweeping college voting study in the nation to equip institutions with reliable data on their students’ voting habits. Thomas’ National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement (NSLVE) compares student enrollment records with students’ voting records (wiped of names and other identifying data) and publishes reports for each institution that opts in to the study. By 2018, more than 1,100 colleges and universities, representing 10.7 million students, had opted in.The annual NSLVE report puts a school’s civic engagement stats in bold relief. On page three, after the cover page and introductory letter, is the school’s student-wide voting rate, printed big and bold like an SAT score. Next to this number is the percentage change since the last report was issued, as well as the voting rate that year for all participating institutions. Bates College, for example, had a voting rate in 2016 of 43.5 percent, up 1.9 percent from 2012. The average national voting rate across all participating schools was 50.4 percent. Bates could clearly see that it was underperforming relative to its peers.Why do some institutions produce engaged students while others don’t? Thomas found that students who attend schools where they feel empowered by the administration to initiate change within their own communities are more likely to carry that power into the broader world.Among the seven schools with exceptionally high voter turnout that Thomas studied this year, all offered classes specifically geared to helping first-year students learn how to discuss controversial topics. It’s a way to confront the “triggering” problem head-on. Four of the schools required that first-year students take classes that use actual current events to help them frame issues, identify different perspectives, and advocate for one side or the other. Armed with the tools they need, students come together to tackle complex problems and find solutions.Which is, in a nutshell, how government should work. Should. But there are a lot of obstacles between where we are and where we could be, between potential and turnout. Back on the ground at UConn, GOTV volunteer O’Hara has had to overcome all of these larger forces to politically empower her generation. “People are so disconnected,” she says. “They feel they don’t have a voice or power to shape the future.” How does a young believer like O’Hara respond to that level of cynicism? “People want to be a part of something, and that’s how voting can make a difference. By showing up, we can shape our future.”2.8Kwritten byRachel SladeBoston-based journo and author of "Into the Raging Sea" (Ecco/HarperCollins 2018) about the 2015 sinking of the cargo ship El Faro. www.rachelslade.netBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDiscover MediumWelcome to a place where words matter.

The Metaphysics of Defeating Trump – Radical Spirits – MediumHomepageBecome a memberSign inGet startedHomepageRadical SpiritsThe Metaphysics of Defeating TrumpIt starts with the power of a thoughtMitch HorowitzBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 26Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesPhoto by Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesCritics complain — quite rightly — that Donald Trump occupies his own reality, as he fires off bizarre denials of the casualties from Puerto Rico’s hurricane, fantasizes over “deep state” conspiracies, and wraps himself in an economic recovery that began under Obama. For these reasons and more, I have called Trump “a kind of Frankenstein monster of the philosophy” of positive thinking.But it is insufficient for activists to bemoan Trump’s personal rise as the inevitable outcome of the worst aspects of American optimism and motivational philosophy. Rather, act the part of a martial artist and adapt your foe’s methods against him.There is nothing intrinsically ideological about the methods behind the United States’ metaphysics of success. And they often do work, as Trump demonstrates, however grimly. Indeed, Trump was raised on the positive-mind spirituality of the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale, and the chief showman’s powers of persuasion and self-invention have proven grotesquely effective. In short, Trump structured a life around the unethical attainment of power. He brought formidable dimensions to that aim. You can despise the outcome — but can progressives afford to ignore the means?Philosopher George Santayana bemoaned the role of self-delusion in modern therapeutic culture: “Assurance is contemptible and fatal unless it is self-knowledge.” His observation highlights a key contradiction in Peale’s approach, which is that blindly self-confident people, rather than accurately assessing their strengths, are often dangerously delusive, as with the president. But there is a different dimension to positive-mind philosophy: The search for self-belief can itself become of a form of ethical, inner inquiry by not only asking about your veritable capacities but also coming into possession of a core ideal and the means to attain it.I have often extolled the power of possessing one finely focused, well-selected, and passionately held aim, a topic I explore in my forthcoming book, The Miracle Club. Some people argue against the concept of a single-minded goal. We like to think that we can balance everything in life. And we are, of course, faced with multiple and sometimes shifting demands. You likely want happiness at home, health for yourself and your family, material comfort for people around you, and so on. Such things are sound. But you must take self-knowledge — something Trump never sought — and, accepting that life’s needs are multiple, use it to dedicate your energies to one core aim. That is where power comes from, like the sun’s rays concentrated with a magnifying glass. Well-roundedness is overrated. A well-selected aim can facilitate multiple needs.Whether in politics or other areas of life, your aim must be specific, concrete, and plain. It must be achievable, even if greatly bold. Beware of aims that are self-contradicting, such as traveling to exotic places while also raising young kids. Or becoming a prominent leader or activist while also having lots of leisure time. An aim is single-minded.An example of this came to me in 1996, when I met a figure who soon exploded across the political scene. One afternoon, I spoke for several hours with Senator Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who at the time was an eager and highly ambitious Rhodes scholar and student at Yale Law School. Mutual friends told me, “You’ve got to meet this guy. He’s going to be president someday.” He was earnest, studied, a little over-rehearsed — and deeply persuasive. I could see exactly what people meant. Cory quickly rose to become the nationally prominent mayor of Newark, New Jersey, and then a senator and prospective running mate for candidate Hillary Clinton. As usual, Clinton made the predictably safe (and disastrous) choice, in this case of Virginia Senator Tim Kaine.As of this writing, Booker is riding high on his performance during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and is on the short list for any executive ticket to emerge from the Democratic Party. You will be able to see for yourself whether Booker becomes president, a role that peers foresaw for him — and that I am certain he foresaw himself — while he was in his twenties. Some were turned off by Booker’s ambition. I was not. He knew precisely what he wanted and possessed the skills, intellect, and drive to attain it. In areas where he was lacking, he was willing to gain the needed skills. He made easy, perhaps too easy, friends in finance, so fundraising got a head start. In short, Booker possessed a hugely ambitious but also actionable goal.Study his rise. Emulate its best elements. I submit to every progressive that the tools used by a Donald Trump can be as easily used (hopefully for the common good) by a figure like Cory Booker — or by you, at whatever rung of political activity you occupy and toward whatever rung you set your sights on.668written byMitch Horowitz"Treats esoteric ideas & movements with an even-handed intellectual studiousness"-Washington Post | PEN Award-winning historian | www.MitchHorowitz.comBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDiscover MediumWelcome to a place where words matter.
